# rcycle

A fast and scalable method to determine a `pseudophase` of cyclic transcription processes from single cell transcriptome (snap shot) data.

TODO:

* clearer separate from prcomp, 
    - use get_pseudophase to "decorate" a prcomp result, but perhaps store       in additional tables rather than rotation and x,
* generalize plotPC: 
    - it currently works for prcomp package: keep it that way!
